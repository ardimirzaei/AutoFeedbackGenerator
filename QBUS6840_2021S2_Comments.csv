Task 4,Methodology and forecasting results ,Use same validation data (-3),-3 The models should be evaluated using the same validation data. It is not quite right to use 16 data points for the decomposition model but 15 data points for the others.,-3,40
Task 4,Methodology and forecasting results ,Use All Training Data (-2),"-2 Once you have selected the final model, it would be better to retrain the model using entire training data (without validation data) to maximize the in-sample information. You should mention this step in the report.",-2,40
Task 4,Methodology and forecasting results ,Report Parameters (-1),-1 It would be useful to report the parameters after training the (simple) candidate models. This would help to quickly evaluate your training results.,-1,40
Task 4,Methodology and forecasting results ,Holt Winters needs training from beginning (-5),"-5 For Holt's Winter models, you should run the trained model from beginning to obtain the forecast values. Or you should clearly state the initial values if you start from T+1",-5,40
Task 5,"Final analysis, conclusion ",Analysis not well documented (-0.5),"-0.5 Analysis on the result is not well-documented. For example, why is the selected model better than the others? How to improve the results? Is there any chance of overfitting/underfitting?",-0.5,3
